echo --- Season Finale: Creating a Security Report and Final Analysis ---
echo.
echo ** In this episode, we will create a basic security report and finalize everything we've learned. **
echo.
echo Step 1: Reviewing Scanning Results
echo ---------------------------------------------------
echo In Episode 3 and Episode 4, we used Nmap, Metasploit, and Nikto to perform vulnerability scanning.
echo Now, we will review the results and identify any critical vulnerabilities.
echo.
echo Please review your Nmap scan results from Episode 3. Were there any open ports?
echo What services are running on those open ports? Are there any known vulnerabilities associated with those services?
echo.
echo [Pause for review]

echo Step 2: Documenting Findings
echo ---------------------------------------------------
echo You should now document the following findings:
echo - Open Ports (e.g., port 80 for HTTP, port 443 for HTTPS)
echo - Running Services (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
echo - Potential Vulnerabilities (e.g., outdated services, weak protocols)
echo.
echo Create a text file and document the following (replace with your findings):
echo [Example: "Port 80 - HTTP: Apache version 2.4.29 - Vulnerability: Outdated, susceptible to XXS."]
echo.
echo Type the following command to open Notepad and start documenting your findings:
start notepad.exe security_report.txt
pause
cls

echo Step 3: Ethical Recommendations for Fixing Vulnerabilities
echo ---------------------------------------------------
echo After identifying vulnerabilities, it's important to make ethical recommendations to secure the system.
echo Some common fixes include:
echo - Disabling unnecessary ports and services
echo - Updating outdated software versions
echo - Using secure configurations (e.g., SSL/TLS for web servers)
echo.
echo Write down at least three recommendations for securing the target system.
echo Example:
echo [Recommendation 1: "Update Apache to the latest stable version."]
echo [Recommendation 2: "Configure SSL/TLS for secure communication."]
echo [Recommendation 3: "Disable unnecessary ports like port 23 for Telnet."]
pause
cls

echo Step 4: Review and Save Your Report
echo ---------------------------------------------------
echo Once you've documented your findings and recommendations, make sure to save your report.
echo This is what a penetration tester or security analyst might submit after completing a vulnerability assessment.
echo.
echo Save your security report with the following name:
echo [security_report.txt]
